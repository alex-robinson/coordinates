C    SUBROUTINE RECT1G 4.1 DATED 13 MARCH 1981 
C 
        SUBROUTINE RECT1G(CN,JCNS,JADDR,PT,NPTS,NADDR,NFREE,NSTART, 
     1    NPTSIN,L,LTOP,LPTR,LBASE,EPSCN,EPSPT,IFLAG,IGARB,SBAREA, 
     2    DELSBA,PTOFF,KNBMAX,VAL,GRAD,Z,ZX,ZY,MM,M,N, 
     3    XMIN,XMAX,YMIN,YMAX,ZLO,ZHI) 
C 
C    Evaluates the C1 natural neighbour interpolant and its gradient 
C    at all points on a rectangular grid. 
C 
C    User provides the TILE4 database; working arrays SBAREA(KNBMAX), 
C    DELSBA(2,KNBMAX),PTOFF(2,KNBMAX), and KNBMAX to dimension them; 
C    arrays VAL(NPTS),GRAD(2,NPTS) holding data values and gradients at 
C    data sites, with GRAD usually set by a call to GRLD; 
C    arrays Z(MM,N),ZX(MM,N),ZY(MM,N) in which the routine 
C    returns value and components of gradient at the grid points, with 
C    MM as the true first dimension of these arrays, and M,N as the 
C    numbers of grid points in the X and Y directions respectively; 
C    XMIN,XMAX,YMIN,YMAX to specify the position of the grid; and ZLO, 
C    ZHI in which the routine returns the minimum and maximum values of 
C    the interpolant on the grid.  The position and spacing of the grid 
C    is defined as follows.  The rectangle ÝXMIN,XMAX¨*ÝYMIN,YMAX¨ is 
C    divided into M*N small rectangles each (XMAX-XMIN)/FLOAT(M) by 
C    (YMAX-YMIN)/FLOAT(N); the interpolant is evaluated at the centres 
C    of these.  Thus grid point (MSCAN,NSCAN) is at 
C 
C       (XMIN+(FLOAT(MSCAN)-0.5)*(XMAX-XMIN)/FLOAT(M), 
C          YMIN+(FLOAT(NSCAN)-0.5)*(YMAX-YMIN)/FLOAT(N)) 
C 
C    The grid need not lie strictly within the window; at grid points 
C    outside the window, ZX and ZY are set conventionally to zero, and 
C    Z is set to 2.0*ZLO-ZHI to allow such points to be detected without 
C    the need for an array of flags.  IFLAG is zero on successful 
C    return.  Nonzero values indicate error or nonstandard returns as 
C    follows. 
C 
C       4  Some grid point outside window 
C       6  Heap overflow 
C       8  NSTART not the index of an accepted point 
C       10 Transfer array overflow - KNBMAX too small 
C 
C    Note that heap overflow is not here a catastrophic error.  A return 
C    value of 4 for IFLAG is not an error in this context - it simply 
C    alerts the user to the fact that his grid is partly outside the 
C    window.  If grid points ever duplicate data sites, a value of 5 for 
C    IFLAG is generated internally by NNBR1G, but this again is not an 
C    error in this context; value and gradient are set correctly, and 
C    the flag is not passed back to the user.

C    User provides the TILE4 database, the coordinates (XPT,YPT) of the

C    holding the data values and gradients at the data sites.  GRAD 
C    will usually have been loaded by a call to GRLD.  Z0 returns the 
C    C0 natural neighbour interpolant, (ZX0,ZY0) its gradient; Z1 
C    returns the C1 natural neighbour interpolant, (ZX1,ZY1) its 
C    gradient.  IFLAG is zero on successful return.  Nonzero values

C    "Outside" and "duplicate" are interpreted in terms of the

     1    SBAREA,PTOFF,VALOFF,KNB,BETAX,BETAY,GAMMA,ICASE) 
C 
C    Applies the discrete differentiator CURLY-D at NINDEX. 
C 
C    NPTS,NADDR,L,LTOP are from the TILE4 database.  VAL contains values 
C    at accepted points.  NINDEX is the index of the point (data site) 
C    at which CURLY-D is to be applied.  KNB is the number of its 
C    neighbours, and for K = 1,...,KNB the subtile area for the Kth 
C    neighbour is held in SBAREA(K) and the offset to it as a real or 
C    virtual point in (PTOFF(1,K),PTOFF(2,K)).  KNB,SBAREA,PTOFF can be 
C    loaded by a call to ACCSBA.  VALOFF(K) returns the real or virtual 
C    value offset at the Kth neighbour, (BETAX,BETAY) the gradient and 
C    GAMMA the spherical coefficient at NINDEX.  IFLAG returns the value 
C    zero unless NINDEX is not the index of an accepted point, in which 
C    case it returns the value 9.  ICASE returns a value indicating the 
C    extent of the edge effects, according to the following conventions. 
C 
C       0  All neighbours of NINDEX are points.  Equations for BETAX, 
C          BETAY,GAMMA assumed well-conditioned.  Problems could arise 
C          only if NINDEX is too close to another point.  This should 
C          have been trapped earlier. 
C 
C       1  Three or more neighbours of NINDEX, but not all, are points 
C          and equations are well-conditioned.  This is the normal edge 
C          case.  The calculation is similar to case 0 but with extra 
C          terms to compensate for the edge effects. 
C 
C       2  Two neighbours of NINDEX are points.  More precisely, the 
C          equations for BETAX,BETAY,GAMMA are ill-conditioned or 
C          indeterminate, but on putting GAMMA equal to zero and 
C          discarding an equation, well-conditioned equations for 
C          BETAX,BETAY result. 
C 
C       3  One neighbour of NINDEX is a point.  More precisely, the 
C          equations for BETAX,BETAY,GAMMA are ill-conditioned or 
C          indeterminate, and on putting GAMMA equal to zero and 
C          discarding an equation, the resultant equations for 
C          BETAX,BETAY are still ill-conditioned or indeterminate. 
C          A direction for beta is constructed conventionally, and an 
C          appropriate magnitude is then determined. 
C 
C       4  No neighbours of NINDEX are points.  This occurs only if 
C          NINDEX is the sole accepted point.  The case is included 
C          for completeness, but will not normally arise.

C    which cancel one another in pairs but are allocated to different
